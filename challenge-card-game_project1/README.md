# Description

I applied for a job as a developer for an online casino called **WeTakeYourMoney**. They are interested in my profile. During the interview challenge, they asked me to build a card game in Python.
so I have stared my project which is called **challenge-card-game**. I have coded a basis for a card game; what this includes is that a deck of cards gets created, and split between the different players and each player plays a card at every turn, until there are no cards left. All of them can be summarized in three sections which is:

- The game is working until each player doesn't have any cards left.
- The game generates all the cards.
- The game distributes all the cards.


## Installation 

For installing the codes of this game card you need to have:
 1) a github account 
 2) clone github
 3) install python
 4) run this code in your terminal 'python.exe main.py'


### Usage

For running this game you should run three python files in "utils" in the repo. In each of these files, the related classes are defined. For example in card.py, two classes which is called Symbol class and Card calss. each calss contains specefic attributes which are recalled by __str__(method) related to calss. 
The palyer.py contains two classes: Player class and Deck class. The third file is class game.py which includes Board class and requiers card and palyer from previous classes. 
 
#### Contributors

This project was a **solo** project, which means that it should be prepared individually. 

##### Timeline

For preparation this game card program, 3 days were allocated.

### Personal situation

Now, I am junior data scientist-AI developer at BeCode in Ghent. This project is my first real project at BeCode. I have planned to extend my knowlege about AI feasibilty and learn how to extraxt meaning from Big Data. Finally, I would like to become an expert in data-driven policymaking and evidence-based decision making.
